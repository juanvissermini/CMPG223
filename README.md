RobustFitness

This project is a system design for RobustFitness.
Project scope
The two main objectives of this project is to provide Robust Fitness with a computerized system to automate the new member registrations process as well as booking of gym classes on a weekly basis. Additionally, monthly member payments should be enabled through the system and the functionality to cancel membership. Current data that is kept on the manual registration forms must be loaded on the system before it is used in the production environment. Development and implementation of the system will be done in phase by making use of the FAST methodology. 
The following functional requirements must be met by the system:
Maintain members: new members and cancellations of membership
Schedule classes: add new classes and remove outdated classes
Book classes: book, change or cancel bookings
Maintain transactions: receive member payments and keep record of payments
Report on income per period: Give a view to the owner on income received for a certain period
Additionally, the system must have the following functionality:
Unique identifiers (username and password) for each user for security purposes. Proposed that an email address should be used as username
Message should be displayed if member wants to book an already fully booked class
Help functionality
The owner should have access to the full functionality of the system
The admin clerk has access to maintain members, maintain classes, schedule classes, book classes and receive payments from members (customers)
Queries and activities on the system should not take longer than 3 seconds
The database will contain dates and times of available classes every week as well as current member information with payment status
